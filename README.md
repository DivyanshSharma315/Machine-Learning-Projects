# Machine-Learning-Projects

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository! This is a personal collection of hands-on projects Iâ€™ve created while learning and exploring various machine learning and AI concepts. Each project is built with the goal of applying newly learned techniques and improving my practical understanding of ML.
